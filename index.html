                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Andersen_(composer)">Carl Joachim Andersen</a>
                    (29 April 1847 – 7 May 1909) was a Danish flutist, conductor and composer born in Copenhagen, son of the flutist Christian Joachim Andersen.
                    Both as a virtuoso and as composer of flute music, he is considered one of the best of his time.
                    He was considered to be a tough leader and teacher and demanded as such a lot from his orchestras but through that style he reached a high level.
